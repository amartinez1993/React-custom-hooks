1. `useCounter`: A hook for managing a counter with increments and decrements.
2. `useFetch`: A hook for making HTTP requests using the `fetch` API and managing the request state.
3. `useForm`: A hook for managing forms, including handling input values and validation.
4. `useTodos`: A hook for managing a list of to-do tasks.
